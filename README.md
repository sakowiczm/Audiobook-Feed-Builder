About Audiobook Feed Builder
----------------------------

This small utility was created as a breakable toy to play with [Kayak]. But it also solves real issue. 

If you listen to audio books and you are a user of WP7 device – you probably already know that Zune won’t allow you to copy your files in a ‘podcast mode’ - in a way that phone remembers last position of a file you were listening. Well, unless you feed them to Zune via RSS - this tool allows you to generate local RSS feed.

Usage
-----

You have to define title of your feed, files you want to include and port on which feed will be published.
Then press Start - this will generate you a link that can be used in Zune to subscribe to new podcast feed. Download all files close utility and you can synchronize files to your device.
